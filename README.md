History is not knowledge at all, but only opinion.

Since its genesis, the Early Music movement has been confronted with issues of authenticity[^1], validity of method[^2], and even reliability of sources[^3]. The quarrel for authenticity has led “historically informed” musicians to look at any source other than facsimiles or Urtext editions with mistrust, neglecting the knowledge hidden behind a plurality of interpretations from music editors, musicologists, performers, and even forgers.

Through the annotations of the _long 19th century_, the Flemish Archive for Annotated Music[^4] wishes to challenge the established paradigm of historical performance practice by adopting a plurality of historical performance practices. In this practice-based research, we present a critical analysis of performances recorded by an expert pianist based on pre-Urtext editions of keyboard music of Baroque masters. Utilizing previous experience of stylistic exploration[^5], we propose a comparative study of J.S. Bach and Domenico Scarlatti works. Our research compares and evaluates the contributions of performances based on a variety of historical sources containing divergent annotations, additions, and modifications of the same works. A mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis complements our postmodern framework in discussing style, aesthetics, authenticity, and taste.
