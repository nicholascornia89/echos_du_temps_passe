# Analysis of Domenico Scarlatti's Sonatas

This is a short guideline to the analysis results for Scarlatti's music.

- The [Metadata Analysis](./metadata_analyis) folder collects data and scripts for metadata concerning arrangers, general annotations tags from the _FAAM corpus_ and information about the works.
- The [MusicXml Analysis](./musicxml_analysis) folder provides information on the score level, encoded in the [Scarlatti Sonata](/encoded_music/project_transcriptions/scarlatti_sonatas). We are using the Python library [music21](https://www.music21.org/) for statistical analysis of the editioral annotations encoded in the MusicXML files.
